# gr-pus
The gr-pus OOT package incorporates the Packet Utilization Services ECSS-E-ST-70-41C interfaces and services into GNURadio.
 
Additional ad-hoc (application specific) services could easily be added later as OOT blocks.

The folder docs includes a document with the description and the user manual, in addicion there is a sheet document with QA test cases tracking

This implementation is based in the AcubaSat one (https://github.com/AcubeSAT/ecss-services), but adapted to GNURadio and including additional service types and message types.
